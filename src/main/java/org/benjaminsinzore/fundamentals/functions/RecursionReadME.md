Q #1) How does Recursion work in Java?

Answer: In recursion, the recursive function calls itself repeatedly until a base condition is satisfied. The memory for the called function is pushed on to the stack at the top of the memory for the calling function. For each function call, a separate copy of local variables is made.

Q #2) Why is Recursion used?

Answer: Recursion is used to solve those problems that can be broken down into smaller ones and the entire problem can be expressed in terms of a smaller problem.

Recursion is also used for those problems that are too complex to be solved using an iterative approach. Besides the problems for which time complexity is not an issue, use recursion.

Q #3) What are the benefits of Recursion?

Answer:

The benefits of Recursion include:

Recursion reduces redundant calling of function.
Recursion allows us to solve problems easily when compared to the iterative approach.
Q #4) Which one is better â€“ Recursion or Iteration?

Answer: Recursion makes repeated calls until the base function is reached. Thus there is a memory overhead as a memory for each function call is pushed on to the stack.

Iteration on the other hand does not have much memory overhead. Recursion execution is slower than the iterative approach. Recursion reduces the size of the code while the iterative approach makes the code large.

Q #5) What are the Advantages of Recursion over Iteration?

Answer:

Recursion makes the code clearer and shorter.
Recursion is better than the iterative approach for problems like the Tower of Hanoi, tree traversals, etc.
As every function call has memory pushed on to the stack, Recursion uses more memory.
Recursion performance is slower than the iterative approach.
Conclusion
Recursion is a very important concept in software irrespective of the programming language. Recursion is mostly used in solving data structure problems like towers of Hanoi, tree traversals, linked lists, etc. Though it takes more memory, recursion makes code simpler and clearer.

We have explored all about Recursion in this tutorial. We have also implemented numerous programming examples for a better understanding of the concept.
